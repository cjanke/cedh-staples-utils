Stuff that was hand edited

## `decklists.`

For decks that had multiple versions (eg breya, chulane), ran the versions through the script by themselves to get total counts for comparison.

These counts are stored as <name>_processed.txt. The directory also contains the decks that only had one definitive version.

## `decklists_processed_condensed/`

Same as `decklists/`, except manually changed the count to 1 for each card in `<name>_processed.txt` files, to prevent massive overcounting when trying to get an estimate on how many cards of each we need.
